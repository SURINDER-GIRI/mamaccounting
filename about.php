                <h2>About mamacounting Business</h2>

                <p >
                    MAM Accounting Services started in 1988 with a small handful of clients.  My client base has grown steadily over the years, and I now service over a hundred individual and small business accounts.  I specialize in individual tax return preparation, ranging from the simple tax return to the more complicated one involving rental properties, stock transactions and the like.

Since 2003, I have been a registered IRS Electronic Return Originator.  This year all tax returns will be electronically filed ensuring you an accurate and timely filing as well as a speedy refund.  In fact, most refunds can be direct deposited within days of filing the return.

Due to the short window of filing, and the number of clients I service, it is better for me to have you either drop off or mail your tax information to me.  Once I receive it, I will be in touch with you with any questions I may have.  Please make sure you provide me with your most up to date contact information (phone / email).  It is my goal to complete your return within 7 days of receiving the information.

Thank you for trusting me to do your tax preparation!
                </p>
